            <p>Hello there! I'm Hailie, a student studying Cognitive Science and Computer Science at UC Berkeley, and an aspiring Web Developer/Designer. I have over three years of experience with design software such as <b>Figma</b> and <b>Framer</b>, as well as coding experience in <b>Java, Python, HTML, and CSS.</b>
                As a graduate from Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo's UX Design Program, I have grown proficient in User Experience/Interface components, such as <b>storyboarding and flow building</b>.  Additionally, as a student member
                of UC Berkeley's CS Kickstart program, I have gained sufficient experience in data analysis, web development, and computer science. With these acquired skills, I have built multiple mobile application prototypes,
                games, and this website! Now, as a current Tech Development Manager at The Bee Fund, I work with other tech team members to create app prototypes for startups and non-profit organizations using Figma. 
                <br>
                <p>In future work experiences, I hope to utilize my technical skills, as well as my <b>communication, project planning, and mentorship</b> skills to quickly and efficiently conquer my goals in any company that allows me the opportunity. But more importantly, I hope to learn from peers and industry professionals, and take on new challenges to exercise my natural curiousity and passion for knowledge!</p>

            <b><p>Personal Website</p></b>
                <i><p>August 2024</p></i>
                <p>Fun fact, this website is a project I did for UC Berkeley's CS Kickstart Program,  a 1-week bootcamp designed for a cohort of 100 female students, focusing on Python, web development, web design, and electrical engineering concepts across 10 comprehensive seminars!
                    As a student member, I had the option of choosing a project related data science, web development, coding in Python, or product design. As an aspiring web developer/designer, I chose to create this website. To create this website, I gained a sufficient amount of coding knowledge in <b>HTML and CSS</b>. While the final product is relatively simple, I am still proud of how this website turned out, and how much coding knowledge I gained from creating it!</p>

            <b><p>Intelligently - Me Mobile Application Design</p></b>
                <i><p>June 2024</p></i>
                <p>The goal of this project was to design an original mobile application using <b>Figma</b> for mental health patients to log and track their mental health states, and educate them about biological psychology with a 
                    special focus on inclusion, prioritizing respectful communication, and presenting content and functionality in ways that everyone can access 
                    and understand. I read up on accessibility-focused design principles, ran multiple sessions of user testing, and refined my design choices on multiple occasions. By no means is it a fully polished prototype, but I am super proud of the work accomplished! Interact with the prototype <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/1384386039920516704">here!</a></p>

            <b><p>PGHS's Literary Magazine</p></b>
                <i><p>May 2024</p></i>
                <p>After reviving the Young Writers’ Club at Pacific Grove High School, the club officers and I strived to bring back the annual Literary Magazine, which was discontinued after COVID-19. 
                    As President, I collected students’ writing, photo, and art submissions and used <b>Adobe Indesign</b> to design and format the magazine with my team of club officers. We successfully printed and published the magazine within one month, and handed out about 70 copies to students and teachers on campus.</p>
